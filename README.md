# ðŸŒ± Smart Drip Irrigation System (IoT + ML + Dashboard)

## Overview
This project is a *Smart Drip Irrigation System* designed for precision agriculture. It integrates:

- *IoT sensors* (soil moisture, NPK)  
- *Automated pump control* based on soil moisture  
- *Machine Learning prediction* for irrigation decisions  
- *Interactive Streamlit dashboard* for real-time monitoring and fertilizer recommendations  

This system helps *save water, reduce manual labor, and **improve crop health*.

## Features
- ðŸ“¡ *Live Soil Moisture Monitoring*: Sensor data displayed on a real-time dashboard.  
- ðŸ’§ *Automatic Pump Control*: Pump turns ON/OFF based on current soil moisture.  
- ðŸ¤– *ML-Based Irrigation Prediction*: Predicts whether irrigation is needed using a trained model.  
- ðŸŒ¾ *Fertilizer Recommendation*: Advises on Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) based on sensor readings.  
- ðŸ“ˆ *Moisture Trend Chart + Forecast*: Displays historical and predicted soil moisture values.  
- âš¡ *Future Scope*: Predictive alerts for pump activation, 6â€“12 hour moisture forecasting.
